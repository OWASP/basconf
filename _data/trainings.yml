#  Description: >-
#      <strong>In person and online training option available</strong><br>
#      <br>
#      This course is a 100% hands-on deep dive into the OWASP Security Testing Guide and relevant items of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), so this course covers and goes beyond the OWASP Top Ten.
#      Long are the days since web servers were run by perl scripts and desktop apps written in Delphi. What is common between Walmart, eBay, PayPal, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google and Netflix? They all use Node.js, JavaScript on the server. What is common between Microsoft Teams, Skype, Bitwarden, Slack and Discord? All of them are written in Electron, JavaScript on the client.
#      Modern Web and Desktop apps share traditional attack vectors and also introduce new opportunities to threat actors. This course will teach you how to review modern web and desktop apps, showcasing Node.js and Electron but using techniques that will also work against any other web or desktop app platform. Ideal for Penetration Testers, Web and Desktop app Developers as well as everybody interested in JavaScript/Node.js/Electron app security.<br>
